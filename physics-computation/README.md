# Computational Physics Projects

This repository contains computational physics projects developed during winter break,
with a focus on electromagnetism, numerical methods, and scientific computing in Python.

## Goals
- Build intuition for electromagnetism through computation
- Develop clean, well-documented scientific Python code
- Practice version control using Git and GitHub

## Projects
- Electrostatics field and potential visualizer
- Numerical solutions to Laplace's equation
